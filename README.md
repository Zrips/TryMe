# TryMe

This is the official issue tracker for TryMe.

TryMe isn't currently open source. It's a premium plugin that you can get through [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/3330). It requires [CMILib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/87610) to run.

If you are having any issues regarding payments and/or other private matters, please message `Zrips` on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/conversations/add?to=Zrips).

If you have any questions prior to purchasing the plugin, feel free to check the [FAQ](https://www.zrips.net/faq) page.
